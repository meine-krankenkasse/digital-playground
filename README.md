## How to update dependencies

### Minor version updates

Update packages to the latest safe version as follows:

1. Run `npm outdated` to check for outdated packages.
2. Run `npm update` to update _all_ the outdated packages.
  - If you want to update _only_ a specific package, run `npm update <package-name>`.
3. Run `npm outdated` again to check if there are still outdated packages.

### Major version updates

Major version updates should be done with caution, as they may introduce breaking changes.

You can do so by using the `@latest`. e.g. `npm install <packagename>@latest`
